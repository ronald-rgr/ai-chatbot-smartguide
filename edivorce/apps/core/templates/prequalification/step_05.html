           would have submitted the registration to the Vital Statistics Agency where the registration information becomes a permanent legal record.

        <p>Sorry, but at this point in time you will not be able to complete your application for divorce using this online tool. Currently the tool supports a limited number of scenarios. In the meantime, you can file for divorce using the forms provided on the <a href="http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/justice/courthouse-services/documents-forms-records/court-forms/sup-family-forms" target="_blank">Supreme Court of B.C. website</a>.</p>

        <p>A <a href="http://www.familylaw.lss.bc.ca/guides/divorce/divJoint_courtForms.php" target="_blank">listing of forms</a> that may be required for a Joint Divorce can also be found on the Family Law in B.C. website.</p>

        <p><strong>Proof of Marriage Translation</strong><br />
        You need to get your proof of marriage translated by a certified translator if it is not t in English. Ask the translator to give you an Affidavit of Translation. You'll then need to file at the court registry both the original Marriage Certificate or Registration of Marriage and the <span class="tooltip-link" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" data-html="true" title="<b>Affidavit of Translation</b><br /><br />The Affidavit of Translation is an affidavit sworn by a translator before a notary or commissioner for taking affidavits." >Affidavit of Translation<i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> with the English translation attached as exhibits. A certified translator can help you do this.</p>

        <p><strong>If you were married in Quebec and your marriage certificate is in French</strong><br />
        If your marriage certificate is in French, the registry may require you to get it translated into English. Contact your <a href="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/supreme_court/court_locations_and_contacts.aspx" target="_blank">Supreme Court registry</a> to find out what its rule is about marriage certificates in French.</p>
