    <p><strong>Please note: Not asking for child support but have children</strong></p>
    <p>
        Even though you are not asking for an order for child support, you will still need to answer some questions
        about your children. If you're asking for a divorce, the court won't make an order unless they're satisfied
        that reasonable arrangements have been made for the children.

                    relationship
                    with those children. You can try to negotiate an arrangement with the child's parent for you to
                    have
                    regular contact with the child. The only thing you and the other parent can consider when making
                    these
                    decisions is the best interests of the child. You can put these arrangements into an agreement
                    that the
                    two of you write down and sign.

                    with your children, generally both of you continue to be guardians after you separate. As guardians,
                    you'll need to figure out how you'll care for and make decisions about your children. That is, how

                    these responsibilities when they're living together, the law does not assume that any particular

    <p><strong>Sole Custody Example</strong></p>
    <p>
        Maria and Pedro have decided to divorce. Their children, Christine and Manuel, are having a hard time coping
        with the idea. They are afraid of the changes it will mean in their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        Maria and Pedro want to protect their children as much as possible. They agree that it will probably be better
        for Christine and Manuel to continue living in the family home with Maria. It is closer to their school and
        friends than the new place Pedro plans to move to. The children will spend a fair bit of time with Pedro, too,
        especially on weekends and holidays. But Maria and Pedro calculate that, over the entire year, the children will
        spend 65% of the time with Maria and 35% of the time with Pedro. This means that Maria will have sole custody
        for child support purposes, although they have decided that they will have joint custody for decision-making
        purposes. Pedro will pay support.

    <p>
        Bill and Janet have decided to go their separate ways and get a divorce. They are having a hard time agreeing on
        the parenting arrangements for their three children. But there is one thing they do agree onâthat it is important
        to put their childrenâs best interests first.
    </p>
    <p>
        They both realize that their oldest child, 15-year-old Marc, is particularly close to Bill. After discussing the
        issue with Marc, they all agree that it will be best for Marc to spend most of the time with his father. With
        the help of a mediator, Bill and Janet are also able to agree that the two youngest children, three-year-old
        Caroline and five-year-old Albert, will spend time mainly with Janet.

        In other words, Marc will spend more than 60% of the time with Bill while Caroline and Albert will spend more
        than 60% of the time with Janet over the course of a year. This means that Bill and Janet will each have sole
        custody of at least one of the children. They have a split-custody arrangement.

    <p><strong>Shared Custody Example</strong></p>
    <p>
        Eight-year-old twins Malia and Emma are very worried. They have just found out that their dad, Raoul, and mom,
        Lily, have decided to divorce and live in separate homes. Malia and Emma wonder where they will live. They are
        afraid that if one of their parents lives in a different house, they will hardly ever see that parent again.
        This happened to one of their friends at school.
    </p>
    <p>
        Raoul and Lily listen to their childrenâs concerns. They assure Malia and Emma that they both love them very
        much and will always be their parents. They also explain that the children will get to live in two houses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lily and Raoul have a number of discussions and take a close look at their familyâs situation to come up with a
        plan that is workable and best for Malia and Emma. They explain to Malia and Emma that they will spend alternate
        weeks with each parent. They will spend one week with mom, and they will spend the next week with dad. The
        schedule will vary a bit sometimes. For example, in the summer, Malia and Emma will spend a complete month with
        each parent. But they should not worry. Mom and dad will work together to ensure that their decisions are in
        Maliaâs and Emmaâs best interests.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since Malia and Emma spend at least 40% of the time with each parent, Raoul and Lily have a shared-custody
        arrangement for child support purposes.
