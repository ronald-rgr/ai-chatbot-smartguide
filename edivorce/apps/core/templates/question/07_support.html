            <p>Typically, Spousal Support is resolved out of court and is
            detailed in a separation agreement.</p>
            <p>Many couples come to an agreement about spousal support  outside
            of court and capture the details in a
            <a href="http://www.familylaw.lss.bc.ca/resources/fact_sheets/spousal_support.php"

            court order.  They can also be set aside (cancelled) if the situation
            changes.
            </p>
            <p>If you're applying for an undefended divorce and asking for
            spousal support, make sure you fill in:</p>

                <li>the amount of support you want, and</li>
                <li>an amount for your spouse's income. If you aren't sure,
                  make your best estimate.</li>

            <p>If you don't provide this information, the court may not make an
            order.</p>
            <p>
                If you're married, you must claim spousal support within two
                years of the divorce judgment. If you were not married, but
                lived in a marriage-like relationship for two years or more,
                you must apply within two years of your separation.

                circumstances/situation.</p>

                <p>
                    The Family Law Act and the Divorce Act overlap in some areas but not others. The Divorce Act applies
                    only if you're married but the Family Law Act can apply to both married and unmarried couples. Even
                    if you are getting a divorce, you must apply under the Family Law Act for the division of property
                    or debts, a family law protection order, or orders related to guardianship. The Divorce Act does not
                    deal with these.
                </p>

                <p>There are big differences in how the Divorce Act and the
                Family Law Act deal with some issues, especially parenting. For

                <p>Okay {{ name_you }}, now we need to ask you several
                questions about spousal support.</p>

                <p>Spousal support is paid by one spouse to financially support
                the other spouse after separation, under an agreement or order.
                The purpose of spousal support is to help meet the on-going
                financial needs of a financially dependent spouse for a defined
                period of time.</p>

                <p>The answers you provide will be used to populate what's
                called a Draft Final Order Form (F52). A draft final order sets
                out what orders (decisions) you want the court to make. This
                will be reviewed by a judge or master.  If the judge or master
                makes the order you ask for, they'll sign the draft order you
                filed and it becomes your final court order.</p>

                <p>If there's a problem with your order and the judge or master
                doesn't approve it, the court registry will let you know. You
                might have to draft another version of the order or appear in
                court to give the judge or master more information about what
                you wrote in the order.</p>

        <h3>How is spousal support decided?</h3>
        <div>
            <p><b>Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines</b><br />
            The
            <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/fl-df/spousal-epoux/ss-pae.html"
              target="_blank"> Support Advisory Guidelines</a> can help you
            figure out the amount of spousal support that should be paid.
            </p>
            <p>These guidelines aren't the law (neither you or the judge has to
            follow them), but if your case went to court, the judge or master
            would probably look at the guidelines to help make his or her
            decision about the amount of spousal support. The guidelines take
            into account the income of both spouses, how long you were married,
            and whether you have children.</p>
            <p>For more information, see the Department of Justice website on
                <a href="http://www.familylaw.lss.bc.ca/resources/fact_sheets/spousal_support.php"

        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>How is spousal support enforced?</h3>

            <p>Many couples come to an agreement about spousal support without
            going to court. Agreements that are filed with the court can be
            enforced â€” they have the same force as a court order. They can also
            be set aside (cancelled) if the situation changes.</p>

            <p>If you're trying to negotiate an agreement, consider the factors
            listed under When should spousal support be paid? (above) and the
            amount of support listed in the Spousal Support Advisory
            Guidelines. Get advice from a lawyer about what is fair.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>What financial information you will need to provide</h3>

        <p>When one spouse applies for spousal support, both spouses will have
        to provide financial information to each other and to the court. You
        will have to share detailed documents showing your income, assets, and
        debt. Both Supreme and Provincial Court have rules setting out exactly
        what needs to be shared and when.</p>

        <p>Be aware that the law requires you to provide "full and true"
        information to the other party, whether you're negotiating an agreement
        or making or responding to a court application. There can be serious
        consequences if you don't. There may be financial penalties, and the
        court could make changes to your agreement or order.</p>

        <p>In the Supreme Court, both parties must fill out a
        <a href="http://www.ag.gov.bc.ca/courts/forms/sup_family/F8.pdf"
          target="_blank">Financial Statement Form (F8)</a> and file it
        with the court for orders related to support. For help, refer to
        the guide
        <a href="http://www.familylaw.lss.bc.ca/guides/mini/howToFillFinanState_SC.php"
        target="_blank">How to deal with a Supreme Court Financial
        Statement,</a> produced by the Legal Services Society.</p>

        <p>In the Provincial Court, both parties must fill out and file a
        Financial Statement Form (F4). For help, see our guide How to deal with
        a Provincial Court Financial Statement. However, if you agree about the
        amount of your incomes and how much support should be paid, you can
        instead fill out a Consent form Form (F19) and file it along with
        copies of your most recent income tax returns and notices of
        assessment.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>There are two types of laws (statutory or statute-based and
        common-law or case-based).</p>
