       title="<b>Registration Marriage Certificate</b><br /><br />The Registration of Marriage is the document issued by
       Vital Statistics (an office run by the provincial government) along with the Marriage License. This document
       would have been signed by you and your spouse, the person who married you (the officiant) and your wedding ceremony witnesses.
       Within 48 hours of the wedding, the officiant would have submitted the registration to the Vital Statistics Agency
       where the registration information becomes a permanent legal record. Vital Statistics cannot issue a marriage certificate
       until the marriage is registered. <br/><br/> For more information, please refer to the
