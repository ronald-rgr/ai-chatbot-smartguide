                    When a couple separates, one spouse may be eligible to
                    receive financial support from the other. This is called
                    spousal support. Spousal support is separate and distinct
                    from child support. Unlike child support, spousal support
                    is not a right in every case. You are entitled to spousal
                    support in certain situations.
                <p>The objectives of spousal support are to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deal with any economic advantages or disadvantages a
                      spouse may face as a result of the relationship or
                      separation</li>
                    <li>Share the financial consequences arising from care of
                      the children</li>
                    <li>Reduce the financial hardship a spouse will experience
                      as a result of the separation, and</li>
                    <li>Encourage each spouse to become financially
                      self-sufficient within a reasonable period of time.</li>

                    Guardians are responsible for the care and upbringing of, and decision making about, their child.
                    There are two parts to guardianship: parental responsibilities and parenting time.

                    If you and the other parent have lived together with your children, both of you continue to
                    be guardians after you separate. You'll need to figure out how you you'll care for and make
                    decisions about your children. That is, how will you divide or share parenting
                    responsibilities and parenting time?

                <p>
                    Even though parents share these responsibilities when they're living together, the law does
                    not assume that any particular arrangement is in the children's best interests after you
                    split up. The law specifically says that courts can't assume that equal sharing of parenting
                    time or equal allocation of parental responsibilities are in the children's best interests.

        <p>
            Please note if you are <strong>asking for a divorce</strong>,  divorces are granted
            under the federal Divorce Act. If you are seeking a divorce, you can
            apply to the Supreme Court to settle your other family law issues,
            such as support and
            <a href="http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/life-events/divorce/family-justice/family-law/parenting-apart"
               target="_blank">parenting arrangements</a> , under the Divorce Act or
            under the provincial Family Law Act. The Family Law Act is usually
            better for settling these issues because it is tailored to respond
            to the needs of families.
        </p>
        <p><strong>The benefits of using both courts</strong></p>
        <p>
            In some situations, you may find it best to use both courts. You could get
            most of your orders in Provincial Court, and then just apply for your
            divorce order in Supreme Court. (You could also choose to make an agreement
            about parenting, support, and property and then just apply to the Supreme
            Court for a divorce.) This approach might save you money and time, especially
            if you and your spouse agree on what should be done.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, it could make things more complicated to have to deal with
            two different courts. It can also be a problem if you ask more than one court
            to deal with issues about parenting and support.
