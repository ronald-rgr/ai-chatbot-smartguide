            <p>A court will divide family property or debt unequally only if it
            would be “significantly unfair” to divide it equally. This means
            that a court will not order an unequal division in most cases. The
            court can look at a number of factors when deciding whether to
            divide property or debt unequally.</p>
            <p>As well, a couple can divide their property or debt unequally by
            making an agreement.</p>

    <h3>Other Property Claims</h3>
    <p>This section is for property claims not covered by the Family Law
    Act—property that is not family property. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>excluded property, such as gifts or inheritances the other party
          received while you were together and property owned by the other
          party at the time you moved in together</li>
        <li>property owned by a third party</li>
        <li>property you’re claiming on the basis of unjust enrichment (a legal
          concept used to get a share of property that you’re not entitled to
          under the Family Law Act)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can ask for an interest in the property (part ownership) or
        compensation (money). If the property is real estate, provide the legal
        description.
    </p>

                <p>A draft final order sets out what orders (decisions) you

                they'll sign the draft order you filed and it becomes your
                final court order.</p>

                <p>If there's a problem with your order and the judge or master
                doesn't approve it, the court registry will let you know. You
                might have to draft another version of the order or appear in
                court to give the judge or master more information about what
