    <p><strong>Who pays who?</strong></p>
    <p>
        The parent who the child lives with most of the time is entitled to get child support from the other parent
        (the payor). This is to help with the costs of raising the child. If a child spends the same or almost the same
        amount of time with each parent, then parent with the higher income may have to pay child support to the other
        parent.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What is the 40 percent principle?</strong></p>
    <p>
        When a child lives with a payor 40 percent of the time or more, that parent can argue that they don't have to pay
        as much support as the guidelines say. The judge or master may agree and order lower support amounts.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a payor makes this request, the judge or master will consider how often the children are with the payor,
        as well as the gross annual income of each parent and extra costs of sharing parenting time. The court will
        also consider other factors, such as the circumstances of both parents and of the child being supported.
