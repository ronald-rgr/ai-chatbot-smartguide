            Child support orders made in British Columbia are based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines.
            These guidelines contain clear rules that courts use to set child support as well as
            tables that list the amount of child support the payor has to pay. These amounts are based
            on how much he or she earns and how many children the payor must support. Each province
            has its own table; use the one for the province where the payor lives.
