<h1>Get Help Opening and Saving PDF forms</h1>
<div>
    <h3>Your divorce forms</h3>

    <p>You can review, print, or save your forms by clicking on the
    &ldquo;Review and Print&rdquo; button next to each form. This will open or
    download a PDF version of the form.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;PDF&rdquo; stand for Portable Document Format, which is a file
    format created by Adobe and is a standard format for printed documents. A
    PDF retains the design and layout of the document so it appears the same
    wherever it is viewed or printed.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-well">
    <h3>Open the form in your browser</h3>

    <p>Your browser (e.g. Internet Explorer, Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox, or
    Safari) may have a built-in PDF viewer. If so, you can open the forms
    directly on the web.</p>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>Click on the &ldquo;Review and Print&rdquo; button to open the PDF
          form in your browser window.</li>
        <li>Depending on your browser settings, your PDF might save the form to
          your computer (see below) or it will open in a new tab or
          window.</li>
        <li>To print, click on the printer icon at the top of the document (it
          might be on the left or the right side).</li>
        <li>To save the file to your computer, click on the save icon (disk) or
          download icon (downward arrow) at the top of the document.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        If you are having trouble viewing PDFs, you may need to adjust your
        browser settings. See
        <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/display-pdf-in-browser.html"
          target="_blank">Adobe’s instructions for displaying PDFs</a> in
        various browsers for detailed instructions.

    <h3>Save the forms to your computer</h3>

    <p>It's a great idea to save the PDF’s of your forms to your computer so
    you have a backup, and can print it later. You must have Adobe Reader
    installed (or Preview on Mac), otherwise, you can
    <a href="https://get.adobe.com/reader/" target="_blank">download it
      here</a>.
    </p>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>Right-click on the &ldquo;Review and Print&rdquo; button next to the
          name of the document.</li>
        <li>Select &ldquo;Save Target As&rdquo; or &ldquo;Save Link As&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>Choose a folder to keep your forms in (for example
          &ldquo;Documents&rdquo;).  You may want to make a note of where you
          saved it.</li>
        <li>Open Adobe Reader: When Adobe Reader is open, go to File, then to
          Open, then to where you saved the document. Double-click on the
          document to open it.<br />
            OR<br />
          FInd the file: On your computer, find where you saved the document
          and double-click it.</li>
        <li>View and/or print your form.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="question-well">
    <h3>Download the form through your browser</h3>

    <p>Depending on your browser settings, your PDF forms may download
    automatically.</p>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>If asked, choose a folder to keep your forms in (for example
          &ldquo;Documents&rdquo;). You may want to make a note of where you
          saved it.</li>
        <li>Open Adobe Reader (or Preview on Mac). If you need to, you can <a
            href="https://get.adobe.com/reader/" target="_blank">download it
            here</a>.</li>
        <li>When Adobe Reader is open, go to File, then to Open, then go to
          your &ldquo;Downloads&rdquo; folder (or to where you saved the
          document).</li>
